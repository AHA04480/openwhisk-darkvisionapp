  * No more *deploy-darkvision.sh*. It has been replaced by **deploy.js** in the root folder. The goal is to support deployment of the actions from Windows too. It was a bit too challenging to maintain shell scripts and Windows commands so instead Dark Vision relies on a node script. Node.js version 6.7.0 minimum is required.

  * The *local.env* file has changed location too. It is now in the root directory.
